<!-- 
 problems with react - not seo optimized. waterfalling = sequential fetching js files.
google crawlers do not execute js. so they do not see the content of the page.
solution: server pe hi page bana ke de do.

 solution: prerendering
 1. prerendering - pre-render the page at build time.
 2. server-side rendering - pre-render the page at request time.
 3. static site generation - pre-render the page at build time and serve it as a static file.

 downside:
 expensive at scale, very opinionated, no CDN, no caching, slow

npx create-next-app@latest 
it bootstraps your apps with all the dependencies you need. and configures everything for you.
it is a react framework. it is a meta framework. it is built on top of react. it is a framework for building server-rendered react apps.

clear page.tsx and globals.css

previously we used to do BrowserRouter, now we do app router.
but in nextjs, we do not need to do that. we do page routing.

This is also SPA.

Layout - root, for each page folder, you can also nest it, you can also put it under a () and
next will ignore the route nesting

you should have your ui components in a separate folder called components.
or you can change the name of the folder. but also change the tailwind config file.

client side rendering vs server side rendering
anything to do with state will have client side rendering. how? add "use client" at the top

csr + meta tags = SEO, then why ssr?
