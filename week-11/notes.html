<!-- serverless backends

Drawback of bre metal:
cold start problems
cost
speed
have to maintain all the time and not able to focus on code 

cloudflare doesn't use nodejs
cloudflare took v8 and made their own runtime

you cant do get, fetch like express

you will be working a lot on shell scripts. revise the same.

AWS Deployment
reverse proxy

need to change the nginx config file

    server_name be1.100xdevs.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}

	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name be1.100xdevs.com;

    got bad gateway

    server is still not running. not able to  connect godaddy to my instance. 
    yesterday when i logged off, i stopped the ec2 instance..
    today i have again started it, and updated the A record in my domain's DNS settings with 
    the new ip. contacted godaddy support. they say wait for 48 hours.

    it is pointing to the correct ip, checked from ping command and dnschecker.org
    , but the server is not running.

how to add multiple server names in nginx config file?

in the http block, add another server block.

hacking. go to your friends pc, open sudo vi /etc/hosts/
it will open on what domains go to what ip
add the dummy  domain name in the hosts file

how to run the server even after i close the terminal?
use pm2
sudo npm i -g pm2
pm2 start server.js

-g: global

serverless vs cloud provider
serverless: cloudflare, aws lambda
    you need to change how you write your code.
    Hono.
cloud provider: aws ec2, azure, gcp
    aws ec2 is a virtual machine. you are renting a remote dambba.
    you can run any code on it.

you need to learn networking. proxy. reverse proxy
user -> Proxy -> Server (Forward proxy)
user -> Server -> Proxy (Reverse proxy)
    proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
    reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to those web servers.
