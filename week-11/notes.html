<!-- serverless backends

Drawback of serverless:
cold start problems - initially, no servers, because they are not charging us anything but if suddenly someone comes, server wont start fast. its called cold start problem.
How to solve this? warm pool.
cost
speed
have to maintain all the time and not able to focus on code 

cloudflare doesn't use nodejs
cloudflare took v8 and made their own runtime

you cant do get, fetch like express
pages for frontend. wor kers for backend.
How does cloudflare workers work?
isloates. one service running multiple users code simultaneously.

npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-app
npm run dev

in the src/index.ts file, you can write your code


npx wrangler login - go to browser, login, allow access
npx wrangler whoami
npm run deploy

chnage the wrangler.toml file
you now have a backend app running on cloud for free.

but you can't use any npm packages. you have to use cloudflare's own packages.
you cant use express.

what's the solution?
use hono

npm create hono@latest -- my-app
cd my-app
npm i
it will give you basic boilerplate code that you can use to start your backend app.

you will be working a lot on shell scripts. revise the same.

AWS Deployment
reverse proxy
nginx

create an ec2 instance
create a security group
    inbound rules
        http 80
        https 443
        ssh 22
    outbound rules
        all traffic
    create a key pair
    download the key pair
    open the key pair in terminal
    chmod 400 keypair.pem
    ssh -i keypair.pem  

git clone the repo
cd into the repo
npm i
node index.js
    it will start the server on port 8080
    go to your browser and type in the public ip of your ec2 instance
    you will see the server running.


go to security group and add inbound rule for port 8080. both ipv4 and ipv6. http uses tcp in the background.
    now go to your browser and type in the public ip of your ec2 instance:8080
    you will see the server running.


but you need to connect your domain name to the ec2 instance.
    go to godaddy and create an A record
    point it to the public ip of your ec2 instance.

can you instead make the server run on port 80?
    yes, but you need to run the server as root user.
    but you should not run the server as root user. it is not a good practice.


Into to nginx
    nginx is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

reverse proxy. you want to have a single compute machine but you want to run multiple servers on it.
go to your domain and create A record. point to the public ip of your ec2 instance. 

    but you need to change the nginx config file
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    it will open the nginx config file in vi editor.
    press i to enter insert mode.
    add the following code in the http block

need to change the nginx config file
# nginx config file
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
-----------------------------------------------
events {
    # Event directives...
}

http {
	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name be1.100xdevs.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}

	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name be2.100xdevs.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}
}
    --------------------------------------------------

    after this restart nginx
    sudo nginx -s reload

    got bad gateway

    server is still not running. not able to  connect godaddy to my instance. 
    yesterday when i logged off, i stopped the ec2 instance..
    today i have again started it, and updated the A record in my domain's DNS settings with 
    the new ip. contacted godaddy support. they say wait for 48 hours.

    it is pointing to the correct ip, checked from ping command and dnschecker.org
    , but the server is not running. start the server. node index.js. now it should work.

how to add multiple server names in nginx config file?

in the http block, add another server block.

hacking. go to your friends pc, open sudo vi /etc/hosts/
it will open on what domains go to what ip
add the dummy  domain name in the hosts file

how to run the server even after i close the terminal?
use pm2
sudo npm i -g pm2
pm2 start server.js

-g: global

serverless vs cloud provider
serverless: cloudflare, aws lambda
    you need to change how you write your code.
    Hono.
cloud provider: aws ec2, azure, gcp
    aws ec2 is a virtual machine. you are renting a remote dambba.
    you can run any code on it.

you need to learn networking. proxy. reverse proxy
user -> Proxy -> Server (Forward proxy)
user -> Server -> Proxy (Reverse proxy)
    proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
    reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to those web servers.
    need to read postgres and prisma again


certificate management in aws

port 443 is https
You cant just point to that port. You need ssl certificate. how to get ssl certificate for free?

https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=snap

sudo certbot --nginx

you might need certificate from a more reputated org than letsencrypt. it might cost you. aws certificate manager.
    but letsencrypt is free and it is good enough for most of the cases.


it updates the nginx config file. now it is listening on port 443
    and it is using the ssl certificate.
    now you can go to your browser and type in https://be1.100xdevs.com
    it will show the server running.
