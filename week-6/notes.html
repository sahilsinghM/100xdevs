<!-- 
react components return only one root element
if you want to return multiple elements, wrap them in a div or a fragment

are we creating one extra div? 
we can use a fragment to avoid creating an extra div
<React.Fragment>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Content</p>
</React.Fragment>
or
<>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Content</p>
</>

every component have their own state

download react developer tools

dynamic websites - dom manipulation
static websites - no dom manipulation
react is a library for building user interfaces

whenver a dom is updated, react will 
re-render the component

THUMB RULE: you must minimize the number of re-renders
you must optimize

how to visualize # of rerenders

open the app.jsx file and follow the notes there

useRef is useful when you need access to the dom element

in strictmode it renders twice
