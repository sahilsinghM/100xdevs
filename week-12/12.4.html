Docker. 
Your project runs depend on your OS.
Containerize. let's ship your machine.

Images vs containers

Image has all the filesystem, code base, network configs. This bundle 
is self-sufficinet. and once deployed, it can run on any machine.
you push it to a registry, and then pull it from any machine.


Container is a running instance of an image.

let's say you have a web app. You can create an image of your web app,
and then run it on any machine that has Docker installed.

"docker build ."
"docker run -p 80:80 my-web-app"
if you run docker run twice, you will get two containers running.

once pushed to docker hub, you can pull it from any machine.

in your  aws instance do
docker pull my-web-app

How to containerize?
Create a Dockerfile

FROM node:20
WORKDIR /use/src/app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"] 

should you copy the node_modules folder?
no, because it is not needed. you can run npm install
and it will install the dependencies again.

create a .dockerignore file
node_modules 

how to create a docker image?
docker build . -t my-web-app .

run this command to see all the images in your machine
docker images 

run this command to run the image
docker run my-web-app

this will not work. you need to route the port.
any request coming to port 80 on your machine should be routed
to port 80 on the container.
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-web-app

docker run -p machine-port:container-port <image-name>

docker ps 
this will show you all the running containers.

how to push the image to docker hub?

docker login

installing docker desktop. the process is so tedious.
download the .deb file from the docker website.

then follow instructions in the below page.
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/ubuntu/

it will open the docker desktop app. but you wont be able to sign in.
it will not even tell you the error why you are not able to sign in.

you will have to close the app and reopen the app. you wont be able to
do it from the UI. Docker desktop will not respond to UI icon.

you will have to run the following command in the terminal.
sahil@sahil-IdeaPad-Gaming-3-15IHU6:~/Downloads$ systemctl --user restart docker-desktop

this will restart the docker desktop app.
now it will show you the error message. why you are not able to sign in.

then you have to follow the instructions in the below page.
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/sign-in/#credentials-management-for-linux-users

it uses pass
https://www.passwordstore.org/


now back to pushing the image to docker hub.
go to docker hub on your browser.
create an empty repo on docker hub.

then go back to your terminal.
docker build . -t <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name> .

this will create an image with the name <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name>
size is huge. 1.1 gb.
this is because it has all the dependencies.


then run this command to push the image to docker hub.
docker push <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name>
this will push the image to docker hub.

you can verify it by going to your docker hub repo on your browser.

if anyone wants to use your image, they can run the following command.
docker pull <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name>
this will pull the image from docker hub.


How to make docker build faster?

go to dockerfile.
it looks like this.

Layer 1: FROM node:20
Layer 2: WORKDIR /use/src/app
Layer 3: COPY . .
Layer 4: RUN npm install
Layer 5: CMD ["npm", "start"]

build time will decrease in future builds because it will use the cache.
it uses layers to cache the image.

if layer 1 changes, whole image will be rebuilt.
if layer 2 changes, layer 3 and 4 will be rebuilt.
if layer 3 changes, layer 4 will be rebuilt.
if layer 4 changes, layer 5 will be rebuilt.

npm install can be cached. it should run only when package.json changes.
so we should move it above the COPY command.

need to add logic that will check if package.json has changed.
then only run npm install.
if it has not changed, then use the cached layer.
this will make the build time faster.



summary:
docker build . -t <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name> .
docker run -p 3000:3000 <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name>
docker login
docker push <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name>
docker pull <docker-hub-username>/<repo-name>
