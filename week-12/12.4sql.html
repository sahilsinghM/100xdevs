mongodb is good to start with. you can move very fast. 
but it is too schemaless. there are no checks. bad code can break it. it is unsafe. runtime errors.

sql has strict schema. you have to put effort to define all the schema. 
you have to do migrations. 
sql is good for data integrity. but it is too rigid. it is hard to change the schema. it is slow to query. it is not good for large data. 

run postgres by docker.
ususal docker bullshit. not able to sign in. forgot gpg key. created new key.
tried signing in. app stops responding. try to restart from ui.
doesn't work. restart from terminal. worls. add new key. works.
docker desktop working now. run docker run hello-world and verified.

now run 
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres postgres
it will install postgres and run it in the background.

How to coonect your backend code with ps. 
 connection string:
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

how to connect with your ps container by ssh? 
docker exec -it <process-id> /bin/bash
run docker ps to get your process id.

you will be in the container shell. run ls to verify.
its a linux root.

psql: a terminal based sql frontend.
this container has psql. you can use psql to connect to the database.
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres

now you can run sql commands.

other than psql, if you want to run sql commands from your code
, you can use pg.
