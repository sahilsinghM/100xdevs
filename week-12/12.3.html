npm packaging and monorepos
go to any project on github. it will be a giant repo with multiple packages. both frontend and backend.
this is a monorepo. it has multiple packages in it. example: cal.com
how can there be both frontend and backend in the same repo?
monorepo is a single repository that contains multiple packages. it can be a frontend and backend or multiple frontend and backend packages.
it has folder called as modules. each module is a package. suppose there is some logic required both in frontend and backend.
then create a npm package. push it to npm. in the other repo, they install the package using npm install <package-name>.



go to npmjs.com and sign up.  you can check what packages are available by searching for them.

npm init -y - this will create a package.json file.
npm install -g typescript - this will install typescript globally.
tsc --init - this will create a tsconfig.json file.

change the root directory to src and outdir to dist.
create a new file called index.ts in the src directory.

write your logic. export the function.

do tsc -b
this will build the project and create a dist directory with the compiled js files.
go to package.json and add a script to run the compiled js file.

change the name of the package to your name. change main to dist/index.js.

then npm publish --access public


go to your npm account and check if the package is there. you will see the package name and version.

npm pack 
this will create a tarball file. this is the file that you will upload to npm.

wait, there is ts file there. you should not have ts file there. you should only have js file there.

add a .npmignore file and add the ts folder to it.

change the version in package.json to 1.0.1 and run npm publish --access public again.
this will create a new version of the package. this is how you will update the package.

now this is a public package. anyone can use it. you can also make it private by adding --access restricted.
npm publish --access restricted
npm unpublish --force 
this will remove the package from npm. you can also unpublish a specific version by adding the version number.
npm unpublish --force <package-name>@<version>
npm deprecate <package-name>@<version> "this version is deprecated"


try to install the package using npm install <package-name> in some other project. you will be able to install it.
now try to import any object from the package. you will see that it is not working.
this is because you have not added the types to the package. you need to add a types field in package.json and point it to the dist folder.
this will tell typescript where to find the types.

in the tsconfig.json file, add the following line:
"declaration": true
this will create a d.ts file in the dist folder. this is the file that will be used by typescript to find the types.
now you can import the package in any other project and use it.
