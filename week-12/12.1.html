 vercel gets very expensive at scale. 
 you should know how to do it on tranditional server

 Distribution and Storage
 objects should not be stored in a traditional server
users, likes, etc. should be stored in a database
objects(images, videos, etc.) should be stored
 in a object stores

 every cloud provider has their own object store
    AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
    Digital Ocean Spaces, Backblaze B2
    Cloudflare R2, Vercel Blob Storage
    Firebase Storage, Supabase Storage
    etc.
    AWS S3 is the most popular

how do I distribute the objects?
    CDN (Content Delivery Network)
    Cloudflare, AWS Cloudfront, Fastly, Vercel Edge Network
    Akamai, Stackpath, etc.
    AWS S3 has a built in CDN
    Cloudflare is the most popular CDN

CDN
    is a network of servers that are distributed around the world
    when a user requests an object, the CDN will serve it from the closest server
    this reduces latency and improves performance
    CDNs also cache the objects, so they are served from the CDN instead of the origin server
    this reduces the load on the origin server and improves performance
    CDNs also provide security features, such as DDoS protection and SSL termination
    CDNs also provide analytics, such as how many requests were made, how much data was transferred, etc.
    CDNs also provide edge functions, which are serverless functions that run at the edge of the network
    this allows you to run code closer to the user, reducing latency and improving performance
    CDNs also provide image optimization, such as resizing, cropping, and compressing images
    this reduces the size of the images and improves performance
    CDNs also provide video optimization, such as transcoding and adaptive bitrate streaming    
    this reduces the size of the videos and improves performance

AWS Cloudfront
    is a CDN that is built on top of AWS S3
    it is the most popular CDN
    it is easy to use and has a lot of features
    it is also very cheap
    it is also very fast

POP
    Point of Presence
    is a location where a CDN has a server
    the more POPs a CDN has, the faster it is
    the more POPs a CDN has, the cheaper it is
    the more POPs a CDN has, the better it is
    the more POPs a CDN has, the more reliable it is

 PROJECT ideas:
 google photos alternative, a better domain marketplace with more 
 visibility on process, a better registrar,   hosting service,
 aws agent. manage and debug 

 when you have no users, storage is expensive
 when you have users, distribution is expensive

 you want discount on cdn than s3.

Edge networks - deploying backend  

create a react app. vite. cd. npm install. npm run build 
dist folder will get created. copy all the content in that folder.

go to aws console. create a s3 bucket. 
  name it whatever you want. 
  make sure to uncheck the block all public access checkbox.
  this will allow you to upload files to the bucket.
  click on create bucket. 
  go to the bucket. 
  click on upload. 
  select all the files in the dist folder and upload them.

currently no one has access to this s3 bucket.

Now go to cloudfront. create a new distribution. select origin domain name as your s3 bucket.
in the origin acess settings, create a new OAC.

this will create a new origin access control and allow cloudfront to access your s3 bucket.
this will also create a new IAM role and policy that allows cloudfront to access your s3 bucket.
HOLD On for now. continue creeating the distribution.
tick enable security protections in WAF.

If you want to have a domain of your own. add cname record in your domain provider.

in the settings tab, select the default root object as index.html.
this will allow cloudfront to serve the index.html file when the user accesses the root of the domain.("/")

click create. it will take a few minutes to create the distribution. and will give you an option to copy OAC file


go back to S3
  go to the permissions tab. 
  click on bucket policy. 
  copy and paste the copied policy. it will look something like this:
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        }
      ]
    }

in the cloudfront dist, you will get a url that you can use to access your app. it will look something like this:
    https://d1x2y3z4.cloudfront.net

but the task is still not done.
next step is to add a custom domain.

go to cloudfront. go to settings tab.
  click on edit.
  add your custom domain name. ex: app.myapp.com
  add a certificate.
  click on create certificate. this will open amazon certificate manager.
  select the region. select the domain/subdomain name. app.myapp.com
  selct DNS validation.
  click on create. this will create a new certificate.
  NOW YOU need to verify that you own the domain/subdomain.
  copy the name, value of the certificate.

  go to godaddy. create a new record.
  select CNAME. paste name, value.
  click on save.
  go back to amazon certificate manager. wait for few minutes. it will show you the status as issued.

  go back to cloudfront. in the certifcates, select the newly created certificate.
  click on save changes.
  this will take a few minutes to update the distribution.
    copy the cloudfront url.

  go to your domain provider. create a new record.
  select A record. select app in name and paste the cloudfront url in value. remove https and www.    
    save.
    this will take a few minutes to update the DNS.

    after 3 days, it will charge you for the storage and distribution. so stop these instances afte you complete the project.

   task is still not done.
   
   react is a single page app. if button is clicked, it will go to some other route like /about.
   clodfront doesn't know about this route.
   so if you go to app.myapp.com/about, it will give you a 404 error since it will not find any about.html page in the s3 bucket.
    so you need to create a custom error page.
    go to cloudfront.
    go to error pages.
    click on create custom error response.
    select 403 error. select custom response.
    select 200 response code.
    select /index.html as the response page.
    click on create.
    this will allow cloudfront to serve the index.html file when the user accesses the /about route or any other route. 
    If your routes are handled correctly in your react app, it will work fine.
    if not, you will get a blank page.

    but it has a problem.
    the response is cached in the cloudfront.
    so if you go to app.myapp.com/about, it will give you a 404 error since it will not find any about.html page in the s3 bucket.
    so you need to complete the invalidation process.
    also complete the invalidation process for the certificate.
    go to cloudfront.
    go to distribution.
    go to invalidations.
    click on create invalidation. 

    next is to connect your s3 bucket to github. which means that when you push to github, it will automatically deploy to s3 bucket.
    ci/cd
