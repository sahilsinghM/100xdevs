Prisma is nodejs specific ORM
iniitialize npm
install prisma typescript @types/node --save-dev
npx tsc --init
root src dir in tscconfig
npx prisma init. this will create a schema.prisma file. this is the only file you need to define your models at
in .env add your db connection string

then do the migration. migration is basically versioning of schema changes
npx prisma migrate --name <give it a name>

if everything ran correctly it will create a prisma/migrations file
you can check all migrations

but how will nodejs use this? npx prisma generate

GENERATING A PRISMA CLIENT (autogenerated clients)
What is a client?
Things I write into schema.prisma file are converted to 
automiatically generating files that can be used by nodejs.

in your schema.prisma file, there is a generator client. remove the output key:value from there.
otherwise it will create autogenerated client in the src folder and you wont be able to work like it shows in documentation
