prop drilling and context api
contexr lets you define any state variable outside of the amin flow
and pass it down to any distant children

even in the context api, the component not using a state variable is re-rendered whenever the state
variable changes.
it only fixes the problem of prop drilling
but not the problem of re-rendering

state management tools - redux, mobx, recoil, zustand

recoil - it lets you define your state logic and components separately
philosophy UI and state engineers should be separate
